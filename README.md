# Python Practice Projects for Data Analysts

Welcome to the repository dedicated to small Python practice projects for aspiring Data Analysts! This repo contains a variety of Python-based projects that focus on different aspects of data analysis, from data cleaning and visualization to simple machine learning tasks. The goal is to provide hands-on experience and deepen your understanding of Python in the context of data analysis.

## Projects Included

- **Data Cleaning**: Learn how to clean and preprocess raw datasets for analysis.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Analyze datasets to uncover trends, patterns, and insights.
- **Data Visualization**: Create meaningful visualizations using libraries such as `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, and `plotly`.
- **Statistical Analysis**: Apply statistical tests and analysis to draw conclusions from data.
- **Machine Learning Basics**: Implement basic machine learning algorithms for simple prediction tasks.

## Prerequisites

Before running the projects, ensure that you have the following installed:

- Python 3.x
- `pandas` (for data manipulation)
- `numpy` (for numerical operations)
- `matplotlib` (for plotting graphs)
- `seaborn` (for statistical data visualization)
- `scikit-learn` (for machine learning)
- `jupyter` (for interactive notebooks)

You can install these dependencies using pip:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn jupyter
